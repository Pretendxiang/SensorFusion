# SENSOR FUSION

## Overview

The SENSOR FUSION project aims to integrate and process data from multiple sensors to estimate the orientation of a device accurately. This project includes implementations of the Madgwick filter in both C++ and Python. The Madgwick filter is a widely-used algorithm for sensor fusion, particularly for combining gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer data to provide robust orientation estimates.

## Madgwick Filter
The Madgwick filter directory contains two implementations of the algorithm:

Madgwick.cpp: The C++ implementation of the Madgwick filter.
Madgwick.py: The Python implementation of the Madgwick filter.
